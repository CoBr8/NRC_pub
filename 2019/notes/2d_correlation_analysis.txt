Notes on Two dimensional correlation analysis (2DCA):
==============================================
    Also referred to as Two dimensional correlation Spectroscopy.
    A known reference point is used as a base model and the new data, upon undergoing some perturbation, is analyzed with reference to the base and a correlation can be derived.
    2DCA allows to determine at which positions there is a systematic change in a peak Continnuous rise or drop in intensity.

    The signals allow:
        1. Events in phase and events out of phase.
        2. Determining the sequence of spectral changes
        3. Identify inter/intra molecular changes
        4. Band Assignment of Reacting groups
        5. Detect correlations between spectra of different techniques.
