# | The JCMT Transiet Survey: Data reduction and Calibration Methods |
# +==================================================================+


Purpose:	To discuss the methods used in reduction and 
		calibration of the JCMT Transient data

Notes:		- MAKEMAP in SMURF in STARLINK software
		  - Starts by taking in the raw power data from 
		  the telescope and then iteratively removes noise 
		  until a suitable model is left.
		
		- Goal of the Calibration was to extract robust non-
		varying sources from SCUBA-2 and apply the two maps 
		(spatial alighment and flux calibration methods)
				
		- Spatial Filtering at 200" and 600" recovered compact
		structure ~ the same
		
		- R3 reduction deemed most suitable: 200" filter 
		
		Alignment:
		- Pointing correction done by fitting the most compact
		peak sources in the map
		
		- GAUSSCLUMPS was used. As it robustly characterizes 
		gaussian structure and subtracts background structure.

		- Map is smoothed with a 6" gaussian kernel to reduce
		noise fluctuations
		
		- Gaussians are fitted to source > 200mJy/beam

		- match the sources between the maps
		
		- sources that differ by 10" are dubious and not used.
		the pointing accuract is expected to be better than
		that.

		Flux Calibrations: 
		- Excluded sources which did not meet criteria
                  - anything less than 500mJy/beam would put
                  calibration at >2% as noise is around
                  10mJy/beam

		- Alignment uncertainty of ~1%
		- Flux Uncertatinty of ~2-3% for bright sources
		
Q?:  CO(J = 3-2)????
