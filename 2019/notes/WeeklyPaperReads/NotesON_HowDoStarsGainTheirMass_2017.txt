Purpose of the paper:
    1.] Describe survey of eight fields within nearby star forming regions using JCMT & SCUBA-2
Purpose of Experiment:
    1.] Discussing discrepancies between the mass accretion rates and the luminosity flux rates.
        a.) The L-Flux rate does not coincide with a steady mass accretion rate. (L-Flux lower)
    2.] Observations are challenging:
        a.) Proto-stars are deeply embedded in dense envelopes
        b.) Accretion luminosity is not directly observable. Photons are absorbed by the envelope and re-emitted with lower energies
    3.] 1 month cadence selected based on estimates of how quickly a luminosity burst would take to pass through the envelope.
    4.] Models predict that a 10% variance in luminosity are possible
    5.] Initial investigations:
        a.) Search for short term variability
        b.) place limits on stability of bright objects
    6.] Within first year periodic sub-mm emission was observed.
