==================

* Protostars mass evolution is dependent on the rate of the core collapse, the circumstellar disk's role as a mass reservoir and transportation mode, and how the inner portion of the disk's transfers material to the surface

* Protostars gain mass at ~10^-6 solar masses per year, however recorded luminosities do not correlate to the accretion of this mass over the lifetime of a Protostar.

* Protostar luminosity problem: THe median luminosity measured to be an order of magnitude less than the expected value.


Our first goal is going to be to take a second look at the calibration of the observations, using image analysis techniques like “auto-correlation functions” so you may want to look on wikipedia or elsewhere on the web for information on how this is applied and what type of information it provides.
