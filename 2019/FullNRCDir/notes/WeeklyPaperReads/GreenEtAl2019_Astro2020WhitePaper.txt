- Dust Extinction causes peak emission to fall in the far-IR

- Mass and angular momentum transportation in disks:
	- Viscous Torques due to turbulance caused by MRI
	- Gravitational torques due to gravitational instability
	- Disk Winds

- Variability:
	- alters density,
	- temperature,
	- chemistry in the disk

- Accretion Variability should be reflected in jet variability

- X-Ray diagnostics of accretion and outflow
	- Jet rotation => prediction of magnetically driven wind models
	- Knots in jet outflow a fossil record of episodic accretion

- Multi-wavelength simultaneity
	- YSO Outbursts (radio flares) are likely accompanied by enhanced UV/X-ray bursts 
	- Multi-wavelength measurements can also track temperature rise from inside out

- High Spectral and Spatial resolutions:
	- Both are needed to probe Class 0 sources in optical/Mid-IR.
