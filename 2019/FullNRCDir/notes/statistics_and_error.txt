Covariance Matrix:
------------------
    # (Auto-co-variance matrix, dispersion matrix, variance matrix, variance-co-variance matrix)

    # A matrix whose entries in the i-th and j-th position represents the variance between the i-th and j-th quantity.
    # ie. for a 2d cartesian distribution with co-variance matrix:
        VAR=[[  1, 2 ],
             [ -2, 3 ]]
            * 2 and -2 represent the co-variance between x and y and y and x respectively. 
            * 1 is the variance in the x data and,
            * 3 is the variance in the y data
    # For larger NxN, N integer, the diagonal represents the variance of the quantity with itself and anywhere else off the diagonal is a co-variance relation between the quantity_i and the quantity_j.
