Personal Management:	Developing
==================== 	
	Colton is well on his way to accomplishing this competency. He keeps in clear 
	contact with me, even during my travels, has managed his time well, and has 
	adapted to the NRC environment very well.

	During my recent travels Colton kept me informed of his health issues and took 
	the appropriate action to recover, by staying away from work for a few days.

	Colton is alway on time for our meetings and keep careful track of the tasks 
	assigned to him. 

Communication: 		Developing
==============
	Colton is well on his way to accomplishing this competency. 
	He is very good at communicating (both written and spoken). 

	During my recent travels I needed help understanding a series of graphs that 
	he had produced and he put together a very good email as explanation. 

	During our office meetings he has a real clarity in communicating the steps 
	he has taken for each task.

Managing Information:	Developing
=====================
	Colton is well on his way to accomplishing this competency. 
	He is very good at both finding information from the appropriate sources and 
	at managing the information that he is producing.

	Colton is programming in python, a language that I am not particularly adept at. 
	He has used a variety of resources - on-line, other students, etc - to find and 
	evaluate the appropriate computational tools for his tasks. Just yesterday, as 
	we were discussing a topic, he was able to show me a link to relevant description 
	of the process that he had already uncovered (and saved for future reference).

Research and Analysis:	Developing
======================
	Colton is well into the developing stage of this competency. His project is 
	extremely mathematical and computational and much of this analysis is new to him. 
	Nevertheless, Colton is using the skills that he has brought with him 
	(python knowledge) and applying critical thinking to both complete and understand 
	the tasks. He has done a very good job of completing the tasks requested, understanding 
	the results, and being able to explain what is taking place. A next step for Colton will 
	be to start challenging and testing his assumptions more independently in order to move 
	more quickly along the learning curve.

Project and Task Management:
============================
	Colton is well into the developing stage of this competency. From the start of the 
	semester Colton has been on top of his tasks and has kept very good notes of what 
	is taking place. To date Colton has shown an excellent ability to take a given task 
	and determine the specific implemenation strategy - such as programming the autocorrlation 
	function and power spectral density function, effectively and efficiently. A next 
	challenge for Colton will be to more independently plan the steps associated with the 
	larger project, rather than work task by task.

Teamwork: No Demonstrated Achievement
=========
	Colton is well into the developing stage of this competency. The project that he is 
	working on did not, initially, have a large team component but after introducing 
	Colton to my graduate student, the two began to discuss the tasks closely and it 
	became appropriate to expand to a small team. Colton works extremely well in group settings.

Commitment to Quality: Beginning
======================
 	Colton is well is beginning to develop this competency. When Colton and I sit down with his 
	work he is able to clearly explain what he has done and talk through the way in which his code 
	works. When errors or issues are uncovered he quickly understands them and fixes the code.

Professional Behaviour: Accomplished
=======================
	Colton has accomplished this competency.

Social Responsibility: Developing
======================
	Colton is well into the developing stage of this competency. 

Continuous Learning: Accomplished
====================
	Colton is well on his way to accomplishing this competency. Colton attends the seminars 
	and talks at HAA, teaches himself where he feels his knowledge is lacking (fourier transforms!), 
	and learns from his mistakes (such as when a bug is found in his code).
