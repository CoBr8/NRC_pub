Understanding Deeply embedded protostellar accretion variations:

The Luminosity problem; A stem of the JCMT-Variability program
==============================================================

The measured luminosity of a protostar is lower than expected 
based on its mass. 

Potential explanation: Protostars form through periodic bursts 
			of accretion

How to view

This co-op term has been:
- Programming in python and trying to 
	understand how to better calibrate the data sets. 
- learning about star formation, 
- and investigating methods (Auto/Cross correlation, FFT's) 
	to help calibration.
