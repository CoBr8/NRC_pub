Using the radius ordered data I took the first n points
such that the radius value of those points were less 
than 5, 10, 15, and 20 (as stated in img title).

I then used a Levenberg-Marquardt least Squares method
in Scipy's curve_fit function and fitted a linear model 
(y=mx+b). The function returns the covariance matrix of 
which the points 0,0 and 1,1 represent the variance in 
the slope and the intercept respectively.

Each image is the division of an Epoch with the first in 
that regions time series data. The overplotted dashed green
line is the fit for that set of data.
